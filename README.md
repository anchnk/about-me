# About

This repository is a place where you can find out **about me**, **who** I am,
**what** I do and **how** I work as a software developer. My primary goal is to
establish my **approach towards work in the IT industry**. It will also reflect
my professional philosophy and show my journey as a software developer.

## Motivations

During my career, I traveled a bit and attended some conferences. One of the
first question I had to answer was: so what do you do exactly in your company ?

Which usually translates to:

- What kind of products are you building ?
- How projects are run and structured ?
- How do you go from dev to production ?
- What is your role in the company ?
- What is your background and experiences ?
- How do you solve problems and difficulties ?
- Which programming languages are you using ?
- What do you like / dislikes about them ?
- What are your motivations for the future ?
- And so on.

You should find answers to these questions in this repository.

I also plan to use this repository in order to build a dynamic resume, hence the
`json` files.

Lastly, remote companies may determinate if my profile fits their requirements
for a specific position.

## Files available in this repository

- **[`companies.json`](companies.json)**: List of companies I work/worked for.
    JSON format so that can be easily parsed for a dynamic web resume.
- **[`conferences.adoc`](conferences.adoc)**: List of events (mainly dev confs,
    summits, meetups...).
- **[`projects.md`](projects.md)**: List of the projects I worked on
    professionally.
